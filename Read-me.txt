FOLDERS & FILES OVERVIEW

- Main Folders List: 

	- Elastic_soil_and_Tied_interfaces/
		/reactor:
		/reactor_and_auxiliary:
			Contains Real-ESSI Input files and pre-and-postprocessing Python scripts related to section 3 (Elastic soil and Tied interfaces) of the paper.

	- Elastic_soil_and_Nonlinear_interfaces: 
		/reactor:
		/reactor_and_auxiliary:
			Contains Real-ESSI Input files and pre-and-postprocessing Python scripts related to section 4 (Elastic soil and Nonlinear interfaces) of the paper.

	- Nonlinear_soil_and_Nonlinear_interfaces: 
		/reactor:
		/reactor_and_auxiliary:
			Contains Real-ESSI Input files and pre-and-postprocessing Python scripts related to section 5 (Nonlinear soil and Nonlinear interfaces) of the paper.

	Note: Each folder (e.g., reactor, reactor_and_auxiliary) contains its own READ-ME.txt file that explains how to reproduce the results from sections 3, 4, and 5 of the paper.



FILE-SPECIFIC INFORMATION 

- Input files for Real-ESSI Simulator used for one of the cases:

	- materials.fei                                 : defines material properties
    - nodes.fei                                     : defines the nodes of the model
	- elements.fei                                  : defines the elements of the model
	- boundary_conditions.fei                       : defines nodal boundary conditions
	- master_slave_foundation-reactor_vessel.fei    : defines nodal master-slave constraints between tied interfaces
	- damping_parameters.fei                        : defines the Rayleigh damping ratios
	- damping.fei                                   : applies Rayleigh damping to the elements

	- DRMinput.hdf5                                 : file to write DRM input forces
	- soil_profile_set1_Vs.txt                      : defines soil layers for wave propagation
	- wave_field1.fei                               : adds wave field, with which DRM input forces will be calculated

	- main_drm.fei                                  : file to run with Real-ESSI to write DRM input forces in DRMInput.hdf5
	- main.fei                                      : main analysis file to run with Real-ESSI

- Main Preprocessing Python script:

	- generate_mesh.py : Python script using Gmsh library for parametric 3D mesh generation (generates a mesh.msh2 file) of a Nuclear Power Plant on soil, optionally surrounded by Seismic Resonant Metamaterials 

- Main Postprocessing Python scripts:

	- print_node_elmement_output.py : Python script that reads Real-ESSI output files (.feioutput) and generates a multiple_results.txt file with the requested node/element output(s)
	- generate_vtu.py               : Python script that extracts all nodal displacements from Real-ESSI output files (.feioutput), applies (if requested) a frequency filter, and finally generates .vtu files for ParaView
